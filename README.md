5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.

## Test Problem
When you visit `http://localhost:3000`, you can see the style of it is ugly!!!
Yeah, there is some problems. Maybe you saw an issue when you built the project.
You should fix it and build successfully without any problems.
If you send me a styled page screenshot, the test'll be end.
